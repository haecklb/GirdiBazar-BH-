This particular photo-masking application is about a square bowl and a potter’s
wheel pivot. Both objects were found in Girdi Bazar, which is part of an Iron Age
settlement complex (ca. 1200-600 BCE) located in the Kurdish Autonomous
Region of Iraq, province of Sulaymaniyah. The objects were excavated in Autumn
2017 during archaeological investigations carried out by LMU Munich’s Ancient
History Department, which has been running the excavation since 2015.
According to the excavators, the square bowl served as a basis for the wheel
pivot which was placed in it. On the pivot a wooden wheel was rotated, on which
the clay was fashioned into a pot. This mechanism is known as a potter’s slowwheel.
With this crowd-sourcing project we are asking for your help to assist
with the 3D documentation of one of these tools.

### What we want you to do

We would like people to draw a polygon around the object that they see in each photograph in order to identify its 
outline and exclude the image background. This allows the 3D modelling process to concentrate on the object itself and 
ignore irrelevant background information.

If you are interested in what our 3D completed models look like, please have a look [at our Sketchfab profile](https://sketchfab.com/micropasts).
